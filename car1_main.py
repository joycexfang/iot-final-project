"""
car1_main.py is the main program used to receive and transmit messages from other
devices on the network. it will run three process concurrently (receiver, transmitter, and motor controller)

the flow of communication goes like so:
traffic light transmits message -> car 1 receives message
car 1 transmits message -> car 2 receives message
